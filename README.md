# music-downloader
Download music from YouTube.

## Description
This is a fork of [Instant-Music-Downloader](https://github.com/yask123/Instant-Music-Downloader).

I decided to create my own fork, to focus on keeping the script simple.
This fork does not have installation scripts and uses only python3 (python2 is outdated and should never be used). If you're running something other than Linux, I cannot guarantee that it will work (don't even talk to me about Windows).

**Keep it Simple Stupid!**

## Requirements
1. Youtube-dl
2. BeautifulSoup
3. Ffmpeg

## Installation
Clone the repo or download the script.
If you want to, put it in a directory in your path.

## Usage

```shell
$ ./downTheMusic.py
Enter songname / lyrics / artist ... or whatever
> we're not gonna take it
Searching ...
Found: We're not gonna take it - Twisted Sister
Download song (y/n)? y
